# Heap
- There are two types of heap
    1. Max Heap -> Always returns the biggest value. In the tree left and right children of a node must be smaller.
    2. Min Heap -> Always returns the smalles value. In the tree left and right children of a node must be larger.

# Formula to reach the children and parent nodes in a complete bst.
i*2+1 = Left Node
i*2+2 = Right Node


(i-1)/2 = Parent Node
